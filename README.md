# FundCamp-Ethereum-Website
An ethereum based project with a website to fund projects while ensuring the money has been put to proper use by involving all the approvals and transactions under a single blockchain.

# Description
People who want funding for their projects can create campaigns on this website and request for donations. But, the catch is, before spending any of the amount donated, they must request the contributors first with a description of where they are spending this said amount. Only if more than half the contributors approve of this will the transaction be initiated. In this way, the contributors can make sure that their contributions are not being spent on something fraudulent.
